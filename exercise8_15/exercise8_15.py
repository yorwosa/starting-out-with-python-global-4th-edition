# Caesar Cipher

# A “Caesar Cipher” is a simple way of encrypting a message by replacing each letter with a
# letter a certain number of spaces up the alphabet. For example, if shifting the message by
# 13 an A would become an N, while an S would wrap around to the start of the alphabet to
# become an F.
# Write a program that asks the user for a message (a string) and a shift amount (an integer).
# The values should be passed to a function that accepts a string and an integer as arguments,
# and returns a string representing the original string encrypted by shifting the letters by the
# integer. For example, a string of “BEWARE THE IDES OF MARCH” and an integer of 13
# should result in a string of “ORJNER GUR VQRF BS ZNEPU”.
